# Implementation Run 5: Final Editors & Singleton Refinement

This run focused on creating the final editor for `AnimationApplicator`, refining the `ArtSetting` singleton, fixing related editor issues, and improving editor usability.

## Key Changes:

1.  **`AnimationApplicatorEditor` Creation:**
    *   Created a new editor script `AnimationApplicatorEditor.cs`.
    *   Draws the default inspector fields (`_playOnEnable`, `_defaultAnimationItem`).
    *   Added a button "Play Animation (Runtime Only)" which is only enabled during Play mode.
    *   When clicked in Play mode, the button calls the target `AnimationApplicator.Play()` method using its assigned `_defaultAnimationItem`.

2.  **`ArtSetting` Singleton Simplification:**
    *   Modified `ArtSetting.cs`.
    *   Removed the `Resources.Load` logic from the static `Instance` property.
    *   Implemented `OnEnable` to assign `this` to a static `_instance` field if null, or log an error if a different instance already exists.
    *   Implemented `OnDisable` to clear the static `_instance` field if it matches `this`.
    *   Removed the unused `_id` field.

3.  **`ArtSettingEditor` Fixes & Enhancements:**
    *   Fixed `error CS1061` by changing the runtime event trigger logic to use the `ActiveArtStyle` property setter instead of trying to access a non-existent `ActiveArtStyleIndex` property.
    *   Fixed `NullReferenceException` caused by trying to access the removed `_id` property. Removed all references (`_idProp`, `FindProperty`, `PropertyField`) to `_id`.
    *   Added a prominent `EditorGUILayout.HelpBox` with `MessageType.Error` at the top of the inspector if a duplicate `ArtSetting` instance is detected (`ArtSetting.Instance != null && ArtSetting.Instance != target`).

4.  **`ArtSetApplicatorEditor` Usability Improvements:**
    *   Added `SceneView.RepaintAll()` calls after the "Apply Style Now" and "Setup Animation Components" buttons are pressed to ensure immediate visual feedback in the Scene view.
    *   Modified `UpdateArtSetTypeDropdownState` and `OnInspectorGUI` logic to ensure the "Art Set Type Filter" dropdown retains its selected value even when the "Use Art Setting" toggle is switched off and on. The dropdown now defaults visually to the first item if none is selected while "Use Art Setting" is active, but only commits the change if the user interacts with the dropdown.

5.  **Design Document Update:**
    *   Updated `Info.md` to reflect the changes to the `ArtSetting` singleton logic, the removal of its `_id` field, the addition of the `AnimationApplicatorEditor`, and the usability improvements in `ArtSetApplicatorEditor`.
