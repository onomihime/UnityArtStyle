# Art Style System - Implementation Run 1 Summary

**Date:** 2024-08-01
**Focus:** Target 1 - Asset-Only Scriptable Objects & Basic Editors

This run focused on establishing the core ScriptableObject data structure and creating basic custom editors for managing these assets, as outlined in Target 1 of the Implementation Plan.

**Key Implementations:**

1.  **GUID Generation:**
    *   Implemented `OnEnable` logic in all core ScriptableObject scripts (`PicItem`, `ColourItem`, `FontItem`, `AnimationItem`, `PicSet`, `ColourSet`, `FontSet`, `AnimationSet`, `ArtSetType`, `ArtSet`, `ArtStyle`, `ArtSetting`) to automatically generate a unique GUID for the `_id` field if it is null or empty. This ensures persistent identification.

2.  **`ItemType` Definition:**
    *   Defined the `[System.Serializable]` base class `ItemType` and derived classes (`PicItemType`, `ColourItemType`, `FontItemType`, `AnimationItemType`) within `ArtSetType.cs`.
    *   Each `ItemType` includes an `_id` (GUID string) and `_name`.
    *   Added logic (`EnsureId`, `ValidateItemTypeIds`) within `ArtSetType` to guarantee `ItemType` instances receive unique IDs, especially when added via the editor.

3.  **Editor Folder Structure:**
    *   Created the editor script directory structure: `Assets/Modules/ArtStyle/Scripts/Editor/` with subfolders `Items/`, `Sets/`, `Hierarchy/`, `Singletons/`.

4.  **Basic Item Editors:**
    *   Created editor scripts (`PicItemEditor`, `ColourItemEditor`, `FontItemEditor`, `AnimationItemEditor`) in `Scripts/Editor/Items/`.
    *   These editors display the `_id` field as read-only using a disabled `PropertyField` for consistency.
    *   They display other relevant data fields using default property fields.

5.  **Basic Set Editors:**
    *   Created editor scripts (`PicSetEditor`, `ColourSetEditor`, `FontSetEditor`, `AnimationSetEditor`) in `Scripts/Editor/Sets/`.
    *   Implemented `UnityEditorInternal.ReorderableList` to manage the list of corresponding `Item` *asset references* (e.g., `List<PicItem>`).
    *   The list elements use `EditorGUI.PropertyField` to allow assigning existing `.asset` files.
    *   The `_id` field of the `Set` is displayed as read-only.

6.  **`ArtSetTypeEditor`:**
    *   Created `ArtSetTypeEditor.cs` in `Scripts/Editor/Hierarchy/`.
    *   Implemented `ReorderableList` for each `ItemType` list (`_picItemTypes`, etc.).
    *   The list elements display the `_name` (editable) and the `_id` (read-only, using a disabled `TextField`).
    *   Ensured that new `ItemType` instances added via the list automatically receive a unique GUID.
    *   The main `_id` field of the `ArtSetType` is displayed as read-only.

7.  **`ArtSetEditor`:**
    *   Created `ArtSetEditor.cs` in `Scripts/Editor/Hierarchy/`.
    *   Displays standard object fields for assigning the `_setType` (`ArtSetType` asset) and the four `Set` assets (`_picSet`, `_colourSet`, etc.).
    *   The `_id` field of the `ArtSet` is displayed as read-only.

8.  **`ArtStyleEditor`:**
    *   Created `ArtStyleEditor.cs` in `Scripts/Editor/Hierarchy/`.
    *   Implemented `ReorderableList` to manage the `_artSets` list, allowing assignment of existing `ArtSet` *asset references*.
    *   The `_id` field of the `ArtStyle` is displayed as read-only.

9.  **`ArtSettingEditor`:**
    *   Created `ArtSettingEditor.cs` in `Scripts/Editor/Singletons/`.
    *   Implemented `ReorderableList` for managing `_artSetTypeSlots` (list of `ArtSetType` assets) and `_artStyles` (list of `ArtStyle` assets).
    *   Added an `EditorGUILayout.IntPopup` to select the `_activeArtStyleIndex` based on the available styles in the `_artStyles` list.
    *   The `_id` field of the `ArtSetting` is displayed as read-only.

**Outcome:**

Target 1 is complete. The foundational ScriptableObject structure is in place, and basic editors allow for the creation and management of these assets as standalone files. GUIDs are automatically handled. The system is ready for the next implementation phase focusing on default items and component integration.
